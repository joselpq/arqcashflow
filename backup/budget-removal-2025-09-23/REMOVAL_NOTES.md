# Budget Feature Removal - 2025-09-23

## Summary
The Budget feature was removed from ArqCashflow as it was an orphaned feature with no frontend integration or active usage.

## Reason for Removal
- **No UI Integration**: No frontend components, pages, or navigation for budgets
- **No Active Usage**: Budget API only referenced in test/validation scripts
- **Architectural Mismatch**: Budget's planning-focused approach didn't align with the transaction-tracking core of the platform
- **Clean Slate Preferred**: Future budgeting needs will be better served by a fresh implementation based on actual requirements

## What Was Removed
1. **API Route**: `/app/api/budgets/route.ts`
2. **Database Model**: `Budget` model in Prisma schema
3. **Database Relations**: `budgets` relation in `Contract` and `Team` models
4. **Documentation**: `/docs/docs-site/docs/reference/api/budgets.md`
5. **Test References**: Budget mentions in validation/test scripts

## Database Status
- **Checked**: No budget data existed in the database
- **Migration**: Created to drop the Budget table and remove relations

## Files Backed Up
- `app/api/budgets/` - Complete API implementation
- `schema.prisma.backup` - Original schema with Budget model
- `budgets.md` - API documentation

## Migration Applied
A Prisma migration was generated and applied to:
- Drop the `Budget` table
- Remove `budgets` relations from `Contract` and `Team` models
- Remove budget-related indexes

## How to Restore (If Needed)
1. Copy back the budget API from this backup
2. Restore the Budget model in schema.prisma
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to recreate the table
4. Restore documentation files

## Future Considerations
When budgeting functionality is needed:
- Design based on actual user requirements
- Consider integration with expense tracking for real-time budget monitoring
- Implement UI components alongside API
- Consider budget alerts and notifications
- Ensure proper integration with the contractâ†’expense flow
