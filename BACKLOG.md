# ArqCashflow Development Backlog

**Purpose**: Central source of truth for project priorities and development status
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26
**Update Frequency**: Every LLM session MUST update this document when completing tasks or discovering new requirements

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM AGENTS

### Documentation Responsibilities
This backlog document **DOES NOT** replace other documentation update requirements:
- **STILL UPDATE** technical documentation when implementing features
- **STILL UPDATE** decision records when making architectural choices
- **STILL UPDATE** README files when changing functionality
- **STILL MAINTAIN** the documentation health score at 100%

### When Starting a Session
1. **ALWAYS** read this document AFTER reading `LLM_AGENT_GUIDE.md`
2. **CHECK** the DOING section to understand work in progress
3. **REVIEW** the TO DO section for immediate priorities
4. **AVOID** starting BACKLOG items unless explicitly requested

### When Working on Tasks
1. **MOVE** items from TO DO to DOING when starting work
2. **TRACK SUB-TASKS** within DOING items using checkboxes
3. **UPDATE IN REAL-TIME** as you complete each sub-task
4. **MOVE** completed items from DOING to DONE
5. **ADD** discovered issues or requirements to TO DO or BACKLOG

### Managing the DOING Section
The DOING section tracks **active work with detailed progress**:
```markdown
#### Epic/Feature Name
**Status**: 60% complete
**Started**: [timestamp]
**Sub-tasks**:
- [x] Research existing implementation
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Fix edge cases
- [ ] Update documentation
**Current blocker**: [describe if blocked]
**Next step**: [what you're doing next]
```

### When Ending a Session
1. **KEEP** partially complete work in DOING with detailed status
2. **DOCUMENT** exact stopping point and next steps
3. **NOTE** any blockers or required decisions
4. **UPDATE** the Last Updated date at the top of this file
