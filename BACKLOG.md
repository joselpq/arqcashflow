2. **CHECK** the DOING section to understand work in progress
3. **REVIEW** the TO DO section for immediate priorities
4. **AVOID** starting BACKLOG items unless explicitly requested

### When Working on Tasks
1. **MOVE** items from TO DO to DOING when starting work
2. **TRACK SUB-TASKS** within DOING items using checkboxes
3. **UPDATE IN REAL-TIME** as you complete each sub-task
4. **MOVE** completed items from DOING to DONE
5. **ADD** discovered issues or requirements to TO DO or BACKLOG

### Managing the DOING Section
The DOING section tracks **active work with detailed progress**:
```markdown
#### Epic/Feature Name
**Status**: 60% complete
**Started**: [timestamp]
**Sub-tasks**:

### üîÑ DOING (Currently In Progress)
*Active work with real-time progress tracking. Can persist between sessions if work is incomplete.*

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è STRATEGIC PIVOT COMPLETED (2025-09-27)
**Previous Work**: Phase 1A OnboardingIntelligenceAgent implementation (90% complete)
**Status**: **PAUSED** - Strategic decision to incrementally upgrade existing proven system
**Rationale**: After comprehensive analysis, upgrading the working `/api/ai/setup-assistant-direct` system incrementally is more efficient and lower risk than completing the new agent

**Analysis Summary**:
- **New Agent Issues**: Excel processing unreliable (0 entities extracted), PDF JSON parsing needs work, missing Brazilian business logic
- **Old Agent Strengths**: 100% working file processing, sophisticated business rules, production battle-tested
- **Effort Comparison**: 70% rewrite needed for new agent vs 30% refactoring for old agent upgrade
- **Risk Assessment**: HIGH risk with new agent vs LOW risk with incremental upgrade

**Decision**: Pivot to incremental upgrade strategy for immediate production value

### üìã TO DO (Immediate Priorities)
*Ready to implement. Start here unless directed otherwise.*

#### üöÄ **NEW PRIORITY: Incremental Setup Assistant Upgrade**

**STRATEGIC CONTEXT**: After analysis, upgrading the proven working setup assistant (`/api/ai/setup-assistant-direct`) incrementally is more efficient than completing the new OnboardingIntelligenceAgent.

#### 1. **Phase 1: Service Layer Integration (Week 1) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Problem**: Current setup assistant uses direct Prisma calls, missing audit logging and service layer benefits
- **Context**: Need to modernize architecture while preserving 100% working functionality
- **Solution**: Extract SetupAssistantService class using existing service patterns
- **Priority**: **URGENT** (Foundation for all improvements)
- **Architecture**:
  - Create `SetupAssistantService` extending `BaseService`
  - Integrate with `ContractService`, `ExpenseService`, `ReceivableService`
  - Preserve all existing Claude prompts and business logic
  - Add automatic audit logging through service layer
  - Deploy as `/api/ai/setup-assistant-v2` alongside existing
- **Success Criteria**: Zero functional regression, same user experience with better architecture
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from strategic analysis

#### 2. **Phase 2: Team Context & Validation (Week 2) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Problem**: Manual auth checking, inconsistent validation patterns
- **Context**: Need platform compliance with existing middleware patterns
- **Solution**: Add `withTeamContext` middleware and existing validation schemas
- **Priority**: **HIGH** (Platform standardization)
- **Architecture**:
  - Replace `requireAuth()` with `withTeamContext` middleware
  - Integrate existing validation schemas from `BaseFieldSchemas`
  - Enhanced error reporting with service layer patterns
  - A/B test against existing system
- **Success Criteria**: Consistent with platform patterns, better error handling
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from strategic analysis

#### 3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4) - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Problem**: Current system limited to single file, no interactive clarification
- **Context**: Users need multi-file processing and guidance for missing fields
- **Solution**: Add new capabilities using proven single-file logic as foundation
- **Priority**: **MEDIUM** (New capabilities)
- **Features**:
  - Multi-file processing using proven single-file logic
  - Progress tracking and better UX feedback
  - Interactive clarification framework
  - Full migration from old endpoint
- **Success Criteria**: Superior UX with multi-file support and clarification
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from strategic analysis

#### 4. **ARCHIVED: Complete OnboardingIntelligenceAgent**
- **Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED** - Strategic decision to focus on incremental upgrade
- **Context**: New agent 90% complete but needs significant work (Excel reliability, PDF JSON parsing, Brazilian business logic)
- **Decision**: Pause development, may resume later for specialized use cases
- **Effort Saved**: ~70% of new implementation vs 30% refactoring of working system
- **Note**: Valuable research and patterns can be applied to incremental upgrade
- **Added**: 2025-09-26, **Archived**: 2025-09-27

#### 5. **DEFERRED: API Review - ClientName Requirement**
- **Problem**: clientName is required for standalone receivables but may not always be available
- **Context**: Receivables can be linked to contracts OR standalone
- **Solution**: Review business logic - should clientName be optional when contractId exists?
- **Priority**: **LOW** (Deferred until after setup assistant upgrade)
- **Status**: Can be addressed during Phase 1 service layer integration
- **Added**: 2025-09-26, **Deferred**: 2025-09-27
