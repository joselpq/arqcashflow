## 📋 TO DO (Immediate Priorities)

### 🎨 **SetupAssistant: Funnier Loading Experience During File Processing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status**: Idea - Needs UX design
**Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Prerequisites**: None

**Problem**:
- During file upload in chat, users see thinking animation for 2-3 minutes
- No progress indication, just stuck animation
- Could be more engaging and entertaining

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Progress Messages**: Show steps as they happen ("Lendo planilha...", "Analisando colunas...", "Extraindo dados...")
2. **Fun Facts**: Rotate between interesting facts about financial management
3. **Arnaldo Jokes**: Light-hearted messages from Arnaldo ("Calculando... sem usar calculadora!", "Organizando números com carinho...")
4. **Estimated Time**: Show expected remaining time (e.g., "Faltam ~2 minutos")

**Expected Impact**:
- More engaging waiting experience
- Reduced perceived wait time
- Better user satisfaction

---

### 🔍 **SetupAssistant: Long-Tail Edge Cases - No Blank Row Separators** (LOW PRIORITY)
**Status**: Backlog - Research needed
**Effort**: 3-5 days
**Prerequisites**: ADR-025 complete ✅

**Problem**:
- Some sheets have multiple tables without blank row separators
- Some sheets have mixed entities within same table (shared headers)
- Current boundary detection relies on blank sequences

**Context**:
- Current coverage: ~95-98% of real-world cases
- Edge cases: ~2-5% of files
- May not be worth the complexity

**Possible Approaches**:
1. **Header Change Detection**: Detect when column headers suddenly change
2. **Entity Type Classification Per Row**: AI classification for ambiguous tables
3. **User Guidance**: Prompt user to separate tables manually
4. **Accept Limitation**: Document as known limitation

**Decision Needed**: Cost-benefit analysis before implementation

---

### 🔍 **OperationsAgent: Include Pending Receivables in Project Queries** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status**: Bug - Incorrect behavior
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Prerequisites**: None

**Problem**:
- When asking about receivables for a project, Arnaldo only considers active/received ones
- Pending receivables are not mentioned unless explicitly asked
- Users expect complete picture of project finances

**Expected Behavior**:
- Show ALL receivables for a project (pending, received, overdue)
- Clearly indicate status of each
- Total amounts for each status

**Implementation**:
- Review OperationsAgent prompts/tools
- Ensure receivable queries don't filter by status
- Update response format to include status breakdown

### 🎯 **Onboarding Simplification: Quick Start Mode for Current Contracts** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status**: Idea - Needs UX design and user research
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks
**Prerequisites**: None

**Problem**:
- Current onboarding assumes users want to import full historic data from spreadsheets
- Some users just want to add existing contracts and expenses going forward
- No clear "simple mode" or "quick start" path for users who don't have/want historic data
- Step-by-step process could be more intuitive and less overwhelming

**User Scenarios**:
1. **New business**: Just started, no historic data to import
2. **Fresh start**: Want to track from now on, don't care about past
3. **Simple setup**: Just want to manually add current active contracts
4. **Gradual adoption**: Start simple, maybe import historic later

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Two-Path Onboarding**: Early question "Do you have financial data to import?" → Yes (current flow) or No (simplified flow)
2. **Guided Contract Creation**: Step-by-step wizard for adding first 1-3 contracts manually
3. **Minimal Setup Mode**: Skip file upload entirely, go straight to "Add your first contract"
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, offer import option later in dashboard banner
5. **Quick Start Templates**: Pre-filled example contracts based on profession

**Expected Impact**:
- Lower barrier to entry for new users
- Faster time to first value
- Better onboarding completion rate
- Reduced user confusion and drop-off

2. **Future Projections**:
   - Remind about upcoming bills (credit card due dates)
   - Alert about upcoming expenses (subscriptions, installments)
   - Cash flow projection (business + personal)
   - Avoid overdrafts and late fees
3. **Unified Financial Health**:
   - Complete picture of finances (not just business)
   - Better decisions for solo professionals
   - Tax planning (business vs personal deductions)

**Technical Challenges**:
- Data privacy and security (bank credentials, transaction data)
- Open Banking integration complexity and cost
- Multi-institution support (dozens of banks)
- Transaction categorization accuracy
- Personal vs business expense classification

**Business Questions**:
- Is this our core value proposition or feature creep?
- Do our target users want this, or prefer separate tools?
- Can we compete with Guiabolso, Mobills, Organizze?
- Should we partner with existing personal finance tools instead?
