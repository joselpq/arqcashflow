# ArqCashflow Development Backlog

**Purpose**: Central source of truth for project priorities and development status
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17 (Cleaned up: removed strategies, simplified structure)
**Update Frequency**: Every LLM session MUST update this document when completing tasks

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM AGENTS

### When Starting a Session
1. **ALWAYS** read this document AFTER reading `CLAUDE.md`
2. **CHECK** the DOING section to understand work in progress
3. **REVIEW** the TO DO section for immediate priorities
4. **AVOID** starting BACKLOG items unless explicitly requested

### When Working on Tasks
1. **MOVE** items from TO DO to DOING when starting work
2. **TRACK SUB-TASKS** within DOING items using checkboxes
3. **UPDATE IN REAL-TIME** as you complete each sub-task
4. **MOVE** completed items from DOING to DONE (then to DONE.md)
5. **ADD** discovered issues or requirements to TO DO or BACKLOG

### Documentation Responsibilities
This backlog **DOES NOT** replace other documentation:
- **STILL UPDATE** technical docs when implementing features
- **STILL UPDATE** ADRs when making architectural choices
- **STILL MAINTAIN** documentation health score at 100%

## üìã TO DO (Immediate Priorities)

### **User Feedback Improvements - Performance** (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### **File Import Performance & Reliability** (6-8 hours)
- **Problem**: Import slow and failing with multiple files
- **Scope**: Debug logs, error handling, performance profiling
- **Priority**: HIGH (affects onboarding experience)

#### **Chat with Arnaldo Latency** (4-6 hours)
- **Problem**: User perceives lag
- **Goal**: Sub-second response start
- **Needs**: Claude API latency profiling, streaming optimization

#### **Make Chat with Arnaldo More Evident** (2-3 hours)
- **Problem**: FAB not prominent enough
- **Ideas**: Onboarding tooltips, empty state CTAs
- **Goal**: Users discover chat as primary interaction method

---

### **Landing Page Redesign** (8-12 hours)

**Current Issues**:
- Too wordy, needs more objective content
- Missing pricing information
- Doesn't emphasize conversational AI
- Too many sections dilute message

**Goals**:
- More professional look (modern, clean design)
- Add pricing section with clear tiers
- Focus on conversational AI (Arnaldo as primary method)
- Reduce content, remove redundant sections
- Show agent in action (demo/video)

**Location**: `app/components/LandingPage.tsx`

---

### **Setup Assistant Production Enhancements**

#### **Improve File Upload Loading Experience** (3-4 hours)

- **Add**: Funny/engaging Brazilian Portuguese messages
- **Show**: Entity count as discovered: "Found 37 contracts, 120 receivables so far..."
- **Location**: `app/components/onboarding/OnboardingFileUpload.tsx`, `app/components/ai/MultiFileSetupAssistant.tsx`

#### **PDF Processing Implementation** (1-2 days) - OPTIONAL
- **Status**: `pdf-parse` installed but NOT integrated
- **Current**: PDFs fail with "Invalid Excel file"
- **Options**: Claude Vision (85-95% accuracy, 1-2 days) OR text-based (60-75%, 4-6 hours)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (based on user demand)
- **Location**: `SetupAssistantService.ts`
