# ArqCashflow Development Backlog

**Purpose**: Central source of truth for project priorities and development status
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-29 (Complete reorganization for clarity and functionality)
**Update Frequency**: Every LLM session MUST update this document when completing tasks or discovering new requirements

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM AGENTS

### Documentation Responsibilities
This backlog document **DOES NOT** replace other documentation update requirements:
- **STILL UPDATE** technical documentation when implementing features
- **STILL UPDATE** decision records when making architectural choices
- **STILL UPDATE** README files when changing functionality
- **STILL MAINTAIN** the documentation health score at 100%

### When Starting a Session
1. **ALWAYS** read this document AFTER reading `LLM_AGENT_GUIDE.md`
2. **CHECK** the DOING section to understand work in progress
3. **REVIEW** the TO DO section for immediate priorities
4. **AVOID** starting BACKLOG items unless explicitly requested

### When Working on Tasks
1. **MOVE** items from TO DO to DOING when starting work
2. **TRACK SUB-TASKS** within DOING items using checkboxes
3. **UPDATE IN REAL-TIME** as you complete each sub-task
4. **MOVE** completed items from DOING to DONE
5. **ADD** discovered issues or requirements to TO DO or BACKLOG

## üìä Status Categories

### üîÑ DOING (Currently In Progress)
*Active work with real-time progress tracking. Can persist between sessions if work is incomplete.*

---

### üìã TO DO (Immediate Priorities)
*Ready to implement. Start here unless directed otherwise.*

#### Performance & Reliability

#### 1. **Claude API Rate Limiting for Multi-Sheet Processing - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Problem**: Multi-sheet Excel files may trigger Claude API rate limits due to larger content size

### üóÇÔ∏è BACKLOG (Future Work)
*Important but not immediate. Do not start unless specifically requested.*

#### User Experience Improvements

#### 1. **Receivable Title Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Receivables imported through setup assistant use project name as title, could be more descriptive
- **Context**: When Claude extracts receivables from documents, the title defaults to project name
- **Solution**: Enhance receivable title generation to include more context (e.g., "Payment for [Project] - Milestone 1")
- **Priority**: **MEDIUM** (UX improvement)
- **Files**: `SetupAssistantService.ts`, receivable creation logic

### ‚úÖ DONE (Completed Items)
*Completed work for reference. Newest first.*

#### September 29, 2025 (Evening) - Contract UX Bug Fixes Complete

#### Contract Management Bug Fixes

- **Contract Deletion Modal - Responsive Design Fix - HIGH PRIORITY** ‚úÖ
  - **Problem**: Modal displayed but was extremely thin and not responsive on smaller screens
  - **Root Cause**: Missing responsive width constraints (`min-w-[480px]`) that other modals have
  - **Solution**: Applied same responsive pattern as RecurringExpenseActionModal and Modal.tsx
  - **Implementation**:
    - Updated modal container from `max-w-md` to `max-w-2xl min-w-[480px]`
    - Matched responsive pattern used in RecurringExpenseActionModal:54
    - Modal now displays properly on all screen sizes
  - **Results**: Modal now has proper width (480px minimum, 672px maximum) and is fully responsive
  - **Files**: `app/components/ContractDeletionModal.tsx:113`
  - **Completed**: 2025-09-29

- **Contract Edit Auto-Numbering Implementation - MEDIUM PRIORITY** ‚úÖ
  - **Problem**: When editing a contract to have duplicate client+project name, allowed duplicate without auto-numbering
  - **Root Cause**: `ContractService.update()` didn't call `generateUniqueProjectName()` like `create()` does
  - **Solution**: Added auto-numbering logic to update method before validation
  - **Implementation**:
    - Fetch current contract to detect if clientName or projectName changed
    - Only auto-number if values changed and would create a duplicate
    - Call `generateUniqueProjectName()` with `excludeId` to exclude current contract
    - Apply unique project name before validation
    - Preserved all existing validation and business rule logic
  - **Results**: Contract editing now auto-numbers duplicates consistently with creation flow
  - **Files**: `lib/services/ContractService.ts:261-308` (update method)
  - **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Compiled successfully (no TypeScript errors)
  - **Completed**: 2025-09-29

#### September 29, 2025 (Morning) - Contract Deletion & Multi-File Processing Complete

#### Contract Management Bug Fixes

- **Contract Creation Auto-Numbering Not Working - HIGH PRIORITY** ‚úÖ
  - **Problem**: When creating a contract with duplicate client+project name, shows "Failed to create contract" error instead of auto-numbering
  - **Context**: Auto-numbering should generate "Project Name (2)", "Project Name (3)", etc. for duplicates
  - **Root Cause**: Business rule validation was happening BEFORE auto-numbering, causing duplicate validation to fail before auto-numbering could resolve it
  - **Solution**: Fixed sequence in ContractService.create method to do auto-numbering first, then validation
  - **Implementation**:
    - Moved `generateUniqueProjectName` call before business rule validation
    - Updated validation to use the auto-numbered project name
    - Preserved all existing validation logic for other business rules
    - Maintained proper date processing and audit logging
  - **Results**: Contract creation now works with duplicate names, automatically generating numbered variants
  - **Files**: `lib/services/ContractService.ts` (create method lines 230-256)
  - **Completed**: 2025-09-29

- **Contract Deletion Modal Not Showing - HIGH PRIORITY** ‚úÖ
  - **Problem**: When deleting a contract with existing receivables, system shows generic message about deleting receivables instead of the user choice modal
  - **Expected**: Modal with two options: "Delete contract only" / "Delete contract and receivables"
  - **Solution**: Created proper ContractDeletionModal component and integrated with both frontend interfaces
  - **Implementation**:
    - Created `ContractDeletionModal` component following existing modal patterns
    - Fetches deletion info from backend API to show affected receivables
    - Provides user choice between "contract-only" and "contract-and-receivables" deletion modes
    - Updated both `ContractsTab.tsx` and `contracts/page.tsx` to use new modal system
    - Replaced simple confirm() dialogs with proper modal implementation
  - **Results**: Users now see proper modal with deletion options and can make informed choices about receivables
  - **Files**: `app/components/ContractDeletionModal.tsx`, `app/projetos/components/ContractsTab.tsx`, `app/contracts/page.tsx`
  - **Completed**: 2025-09-29
