### **Dashboard "Resolver" Modals Redesign** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-27)
**Impact**: Transformed first-touch experience from overwhelming to delightful
**Time Spent**: ~3 hours (all 5 steps)
**Status**: Production-ready

**Problem Solved**:
Users clicking "Resolver" on overdue items were greeted with 14-21 field forms. This created:
- Analysis paralysis (which fields matter?)
- Slow resolution (30+ seconds)
- High abandonment (~40%)
- Poor first impression after onboarding

**Solution Implemented**: "Quick Actions First" Pattern
- Progressive disclosure: Action selection → Minimal form → Full form (opt-in)
- Task-oriented UX: "What do you want to do?" vs "Fill these fields"
- Smart defaults: Today's date, full amount pre-filled
- Friendly copy: "Quando você recebeu?" vs "Received Date"

**Implementation**:
- [x] QuickResolveModal - Action selection with 2 big buttons + small "editar detalhes" link
- [x] QuickReceiveForm - 2 fields (date + amount) with smart defaults
- [x] QuickPostponeForm - 1 field (new date) with quick +7/+15/+30 day buttons
- [x] Dashboard integration - Seamless flow with back navigation
- [x] Full forms preserved - Accessible via "editar detalhes" link

**Files Created**:
- `app/components/modals/QuickResolveModal.tsx`
- `app/components/modals/QuickReceiveForm.tsx`
- `app/components/modals/QuickPostponeForm.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx` (Dashboard - integrated quick modals, added handlers)

**Expected Impact** (to be measured):
- Time to resolve: 30s → 5s (83% reduction) ⏱️
- Click count: 15+ → 3 clicks ✓
- Completion rate: ~60% → ~95% 📈
- First impression: "This is complicated" → "This is easy!" 😊

**UX Improvements**:
- ✅ Visual hierarchy: Green primary button, blue secondary, small text link
- ✅ Contextual info: Shows entity details, days overdue, amount
- ✅ Progressive complexity: Can go deeper if needed
- ✅ Mobile responsive: Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ Keyboard accessible: Tab navigation, Enter to submit
- ✅ Error handling: Validation, network failures
- ✅ Loading states: Disabled buttons, "Salvando..." text

**Result**: Critical first impression moment transformed from cognitive burden to confidence builder

**Related**: BACKLOG Dashboard Modals entry, User Feedback priorities

### **Phase 1: Registration Auto-Login to Onboarding** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-17)
**Impact**: Seamless entry from registration to onboarding with zero UI flash
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours (implementation + edge case fixes)
**Status**: Production-ready, all flash issues resolved

**Implementation**:
- [x] Auto-login after successful registration
- [x] Redirect to `/onboarding` instead of `/login`
- [x] Handle edge cases (duplicate emails, validation errors)
- [x] Prevent authenticated users from accessing registration (back button fix)
- [x] Hide NavBar on `/login`, `/register`, `/onboarding` regardless of auth status
- [x] Hide GlobalChat on onboarding page
- [x] Fix auth page flash with early return when authenticated

**Files Modified**:
- `app/register/page.tsx` (auto-login + anti-flash logic)
- `app/login/page.tsx` (auth check + early return)
- `app/components/NavBar.tsx` (simplified conditional)
- `app/components/chat/GlobalChat.tsx` (hide on onboarding)

**Result**: Seamless registration → auto-login → onboarding flow with zero flash
