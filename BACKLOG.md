- **Context**: When Claude extracts receivables from documents, the title defaults to project name
- **Solution**: Enhance receivable title generation to include more context (e.g., "Payment for [Project] - Milestone 1")
- **Priority**: **MEDIUM** (UX improvement)
- **Files**: `SetupAssistantService.ts`, receivable creation logic
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from manual testing feedback

#### 6. **Contract Deletion with Receivables - Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Cannot delete contracts with associated receivables, but error message is generic
- **Context**: Foreign key constraint prevents deletion but user gets unclear error
- **Solution**:
  - **Option A**: Allow cascade deletion (delete contract and all receivables)
  - **Option B**: Provide clear error message with option to unlink receivables first
  - **Option C**: Provide choice: "Delete contract only (unlink receivables)" or "Delete contract and all receivables"
- **Priority**: **HIGH** (User experience)
- **Files**: `ContractService.ts`, API error handling, UI deletion flows
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from manual testing feedback

- **Priority**: **LOW** (Nice to have after core multi-file works)
- **Files**: Progress tracking infrastructure, UI components
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from Phase 2 planning

#### 10. **Add Files During Processing**
- **Problem**: Users must wait for current batch to complete before adding more files
- **Context**: Phase 2 allows adding files after completion, could allow during processing
- **Solution**: Queue management system for adding files to active processing
- **Priority**: **LOW** (Complex feature, low user demand expected)
- **Files**: UI state management, processing queue system
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from Phase 2 planning

- **Solution**: Detect and merge/warn about potential duplicates across files
- **Priority**: **LOW** (Nice to have, depends on user patterns)
- **Files**: Duplicate detection algorithms, UI for resolution
- **Added**: 2025-09-27 from Phase 2 planning

#### 13. **DEFERRED: API Review - ClientName Requirement**
- **Problem**: clientName is required for standalone receivables but may not always be available
- **Context**: Receivables can be linked to contracts OR standalone
- **Solution**: Review business logic - should clientName be optional when contractId exists?
- **Priority**: **LOW** (Deferred until after setup assistant upgrade)
- **Status**: Can be addressed during Phase 1 service layer integration
- **Added**: 2025-09-26, **Deferred**: 2025-09-27
