- **Problem**: Import slow and failing with multiple files
- **Scope**: Debug logs, error handling, performance profiling
- **Priority**: HIGH (affects onboarding experience)

#### **Chat with Arnaldo Latency** (4-6 hours)
- **Problem**: User perceives lag
- **Goal**: Sub-second response start
- **Needs**: Claude API latency profiling, streaming optimization

#### **Make Chat with Arnaldo More Evident** (2-3 hours)
- **Problem**: FAB not prominent enough
- **Ideas**: Onboarding tooltips, empty state CTAs
- **Goal**: Users discover chat as primary interaction method

---

### **Dashboard "Resolver" Modals Simplification** (3-4 hours) (HIGH PRIORITY - First Interaction)

**Problem**: "Resolver" button modals may be one of the first user interactions with the platform after onboarding
**Current State**: Modals might be too complex or overwhelming for new users
**Goals**:
- Review all "Resolver" button modals on Dashboard page
- Simplify forms and reduce cognitive load
- Ensure clear, friendly copy for first-time users
- Streamline workflows (fewer steps/clicks)
- Consider progressive disclosure patterns

**Impact**: Critical for first impression and user confidence with the platform
**Location**: `app/page.tsx` (Dashboard), related modal components

---

### **Landing Page Redesign** (8-12 hours)

**Current Issues**:

- **Location**: `app/components/onboarding/OnboardingFileUpload.tsx`, `app/components/ai/MultiFileSetupAssistant.tsx`

#### **PDF Processing Implementation** (1-2 days) - OPTIONAL
- **Status**: `pdf-parse` installed but NOT integrated
