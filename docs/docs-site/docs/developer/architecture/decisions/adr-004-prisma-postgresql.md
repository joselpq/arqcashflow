# ADR-004: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL Database

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: This ADR covers the decision to use Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL as the data layer for ArqCashflow
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of ORMs, relational databases, type-safe database operations, and migration management
**Key Patterns**:
- Type-safe database operations with generated TypeScript types
- Migration-first database schema management
- Team-based data isolation at the ORM level
- Development with SQLite, production with PostgreSQL
- Relationship-rich financial data modeling

## Status

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-12-12
**Decision Makers**: Backend Team, Database Architect, DevOps
**Supersedes**: N/A (initial database stack decision)

## Context

### Problem Statement
ArqCashflow required a robust data layer solution that could:
- Handle complex financial relationships (contracts, receivables, expenses, budgets)
- Provide type-safe database operations to prevent runtime errors
- Support team-based data isolation for multi-tenant architecture
- Enable rapid development with good developer experience
- Scale efficiently for growing architectural firms
- Maintain data integrity for financial information

### Constraints
- **Financial Data Integrity**: Zero tolerance for data corruption or loss
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete data isolation between architectural firms
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms query response times for dashboard operations
- **Type Safety**: Prevent runtime errors in financial calculations
- **Development Speed**: Fast iteration cycles for small development team
- **Deployment**: Support for both cloud and self-hosted deployments
- **Migration Management**: Safe, reversible database schema changes

### Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Complex relational data modeling (contracts → receivables → payments)
  - Full CRUD operations with team-based filtering
  - Transaction support for financial operations
  - Migration management for schema evolution
  - Type-safe query building and result handling
  - Connection pooling for production scalability
- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Query performance under 100ms for typical operations
  - 99.9% data integrity (no corruption or loss)
  - Type safety across all database operations
  - Development database setup under 5 minutes
  - Production database scaling to 100k+ records per team

## Decision

### What We Decided
Adopt Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL as the primary data layer:
1. **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations with generated client
2. **PostgreSQL**: Production database with ACID compliance and JSON support
3. **SQLite**: Development database for fast local development
4. **Migration-first**: Schema changes through Prisma migrations
5. **Team Filtering**: Built-in team isolation at query level
6. **Connection Pooling**: Prisma connection pooling for production performance

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types prevent runtime database errors
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API with excellent debugging and introspection
- **Migration Management**: Robust, reversible migration system with version control
- **Performance**: Efficient query generation and connection pooling
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Strong PostgreSQL support with advanced features
- **Team Isolation**: Natural support for team-based filtering patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Excellent Next.js integration and community support

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: TypeORM with PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Use TypeORM with decorator-based entity definitions
- **Pros**: Mature ORM, good PostgreSQL support, repository patterns
- **Cons**: Heavier runtime overhead, complex decorator syntax, migration challenges
- **Why Not Chosen**: Prisma's generated client and type safety were superior

### Option 2: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Lightweight, SQL-first ORM with TypeScript support
- **Pros**: Close to SQL, excellent performance, type-safe queries
- **Cons**: Newer ecosystem, more manual work, less integrated tooling
- **Why Not Chosen**: Team productivity and migration management favored Prisma

### Option 3: Raw SQL with pg (node-postgres)
- **Description**: Direct PostgreSQL queries using native driver
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, full SQL control, no abstraction overhead
- **Cons**: No type safety, manual migration management, verbose code
- **Why Not Chosen**: Type safety and developer experience requirements

### Option 4: Sequelize ORM
- **Description**: Traditional JavaScript ORM with model definitions
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, good documentation, wide adoption
- **Cons**: JavaScript-first (weak TypeScript support), runtime overhead
- **Why Not Chosen**: Poor TypeScript integration and outdated patterns

### Option 5: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Description**: NoSQL document database with object modeling
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, JSON-native, horizontal scaling
- **Cons**: No ACID guarantees, complex relationships, financial data risks
- **Why Not Chosen**: Financial data requires ACID compliance and strong relationships

## Implementation

### What Changes
- **Database Schema**: Prisma schema with team-based isolation patterns
- **Client Generation**: Automated TypeScript client generation
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled schema changes through Prisma
- **Connection Management**: Prisma client with connection pooling
- **Development Setup**: SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Query Patterns**: Standardized team-filtered query patterns

### Migration Strategy
1. **Schema Definition**: Design initial Prisma schema with team relationships
2. **Migration Creation**: Generate and test initial migrations
3. **Client Integration**: Implement Prisma client in application layers
4. **Data Seeding**: Create seed data for development and testing
5. **Production Deployment**: Set up PostgreSQL with proper indexing
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement query optimization and monitoring

### Timeline
- **Week 1**: Schema design and initial Prisma setup
- **Week 2**: Core entity implementation and relationships
- **Week 3**: API integration and query pattern development
- **Week 4**: Production deployment and performance optimization

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types prevent database runtime errors
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive query API with excellent IDE support
- **Migration Safety**: Version-controlled, reversible database changes
- **Performance**: Efficient query generation and connection management
- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance ensures financial data consistency
- **Team Isolation**: Natural support for multi-tenant filtering patterns
- **Debugging**: Excellent query logging and performance monitoring

### Negative Consequences
- **Abstraction Layer**: Additional layer between application and database
- **Bundle Size**: Prisma client adds to application bundle size
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Prisma-specific query patterns and migration format
- **Complex Queries**: Some advanced SQL patterns require raw queries
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Prisma-specific patterns and migration workflow

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Prisma version updates breaking existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, careful version upgrades, migration testing
- **Risk**: Performance issues with complex queries
  - **Mitigation**: Query optimization, indexing strategy, raw SQL fallback for complex cases
- **Risk**: Database connection pool exhaustion
  - **Mitigation**: Connection monitoring, proper connection limits, connection pooling configuration
- **Risk**: Migration failures in production
  - **Mitigation**: Migration testing in staging, backup strategies, rollback procedures

## Validation

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: Database operations complete under 100ms for 95% of queries
- **Type Safety**: Zero runtime type errors in database operations
- **Developer Productivity**: Database feature development 40% faster than raw SQL
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data corruption incidents in production
- **Migration Success**: 100% successful migration deployments without data loss

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Performance monitoring and optimization review
- **Quarterly**: Schema evolution and relationship optimization
- **Annually**: Major version upgrade evaluation and migration strategy
- **Trigger Events**: Performance degradation, data integrity issues, major Prisma updates
