# ADR-002: Claude AI Integration Strategy

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: This ADR covers the decision to integrate Claude AI for document processing, natural language understanding, and intelligent financial analysis
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of LLM APIs, document processing workflows, and financial domain requirements
**Key Patterns**:
- Dual model approach (Haiku for speed, Sonnet for complexity)
- Smart upload strategy for large documents (up to 32MB)
- Context-aware document analysis with domain expertise
- Brazilian Portuguese optimization for local market
- Conversation memory for multi-turn interactions

## Status

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Decision Makers**: CTO, Product Team, AI Architect
**Supersedes**: N/A (initial AI integration decision)

## Context

### Problem Statement
ArqCashflow handles complex financial documents (contracts, invoices, receipts) that require intelligent processing and analysis. Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone. Users need:
- Automatic document categorization and data extraction
- Natural language queries about financial data
- Intelligent validation and anomaly detection
- Brazilian Portuguese support for local documents

### Constraints
- **Performance**: Document processing must be fast enough for real-time use
- **Cost**: AI API costs must be reasonable for SaaS pricing model
- **Accuracy**: Financial data extraction must be highly accurate
- **Language**: Must support Brazilian Portuguese documents and queries
- **Scale**: Must handle documents up to 32MB (large architectural drawings with contracts)
- **Security**: Financial documents require secure processing

### Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Document upload and processing (PDF, images, text)
  - Automatic categorization (contracts, invoices, receipts)
  - Data extraction from structured and unstructured documents
  - Natural language queries about financial data
  - Multi-turn conversations with context retention
- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Processing time under 10 seconds for typical documents
  - 95%+ accuracy for financial data extraction
  - Support for files up to 32MB
  - Brazilian Portuguese language support
  - Secure document handling (no data retention by AI provider)

## Decision

### What We Decided
Integrate Claude AI (Anthropic) with a dual-model strategy:
1. **Claude Haiku 3.5**: Fast classification and simple extraction tasks
2. **Claude Sonnet 3.5**: Complex reasoning, analysis, and document processing
3. **Smart Upload Strategy**: Automatic selection between Vision API and file upload based on document size
4. **Domain Expertise**: Pre-trained prompts for Brazilian financial document types
5. **Conversation System**: Persistent context for multi-turn interactions

### Rationale
- **Technical Excellence**: Claude's superior document understanding and reasoning capabilities
- **Vision Support**: Native support for PDF and image analysis without preprocessing
- **Large File Support**: 32MB file size limit supports architectural drawings with contracts
- **Language Support**: Strong Portuguese language capabilities
- **Cost Efficiency**: Dual model approach optimizes performance vs cost
- **Security**: Anthropic's no-training policy protects sensitive financial data

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision
- **Description**: Use GPT-4 Turbo with vision capabilities for document processing
- **Pros**: Well-established API, good general performance, extensive ecosystem
- **Cons**: Limited file size (20MB), weaker Portuguese support, data retention concerns
- **Why Not Chosen**: File size limitations and language support insufficient for Brazilian market

### Option 2: Google Vertex AI (PaLM/Gemini)
- **Description**: Use Google's enterprise AI services for document processing
- **Pros**: Strong integration with Google Workspace, good pricing, enterprise support
- **Cons**: Complex setup, limited document understanding compared to Claude, weaker reasoning
- **Why Not Chosen**: Claude's superior document analysis capabilities were decisive

### Option 3: Azure OpenAI Service
- **Description**: Use Microsoft's managed OpenAI services with enterprise features
- **Pros**: Enterprise compliance, hybrid cloud options, good integration with Microsoft stack
- **Cons**: Same underlying model limitations as OpenAI, higher complexity, cost
- **Why Not Chosen**: Technical limitations outweighed enterprise benefits

### Option 4: Custom ML Model
- **Description**: Train custom models for document processing and financial analysis
- **Pros**: Complete control, potential cost savings at scale, domain-specific optimization
- **Cons**: Massive development effort, requires ML expertise, long time to market
- **Why Not Chosen**: Resource constraints and time-to-market requirements

## Implementation

### What Changes
- **API Integration**: New `/api/ai/` endpoints for document processing and chat
- **Document Processing**: Smart upload strategy with automatic model selection
- **Chat System**: Persistent conversations with context management
- **Prompt Engineering**: Domain-specific prompts for Brazilian financial documents
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- **Security**: Secure API key management and request validation

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Basic document upload and categorization
2. **Phase 2**: Data extraction and form pre-filling
3. **Phase 3**: Natural language queries and chat interface
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced analysis and insights
5. **Phase 5**: Integration with existing financial workflows

### Timeline
- **Week 1**: API integration and basic document processing
- **Week 2**: Smart upload strategy and model selection logic
- **Week 3**: Chat system and conversation management
- **Week 4**: Brazilian Portuguese prompt optimization and testing

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **User Experience**: Dramatically reduces manual data entry time
- **Accuracy**: AI-powered validation reduces human errors
- **Productivity**: Architects can focus on design rather than administrative tasks
- **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced AI features differentiate from competitors
- **Scalability**: AI handles increased document volume without additional staff
- **Language Support**: Native Brazilian Portuguese support improves adoption

### Negative Consequences
- **API Dependency**: Critical dependency on Anthropic's service availability
- **Cost Structure**: Variable costs based on usage (needs monitoring and optimization)
- **Complexity**: AI features add system complexity and potential failure points
- **Data Privacy**: Requires careful handling of sensitive financial documents
- **Performance Variability**: AI response times can vary based on load and complexity

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: API service outages affecting core functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation to manual entry, service monitoring and alerts
- **Risk**: High AI API costs impacting profitability
  - **Mitigation**: Usage monitoring, rate limiting, cost alerts and budgets
- **Risk**: Inaccurate data extraction causing financial errors
  - **Mitigation**: Human validation workflows, confidence scoring, audit trails
- **Risk**: Privacy concerns with document processing
  - **Mitigation**: Clear privacy policy, no-training agreements, data encryption

## Validation

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: Document processing completes in under 10 seconds for 90% of documents
- **Accuracy**: Data extraction accuracy above 95% for structured financial documents
- **User Adoption**: 80% of users utilize AI features within 30 days of onboarding
- **Cost Efficiency**: AI processing costs remain under 15% of subscription revenue
- **Language Quality**: Portuguese language understanding rated 4.5/5 by Brazilian users

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Performance metrics review and cost optimization
- **Quarterly**: Accuracy assessment and prompt optimization
- **Annually**: Technology review and potential model upgrades
- **Trigger Events**: API changes, significant cost increases, accuracy degradation
