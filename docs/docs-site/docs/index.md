### **Pattern-Driven Content**
- **Executable Examples**: All code examples are tested and working
- **Decision Traceability**: ADRs preserve why decisions were made
- **Context Preservation**: Background and rationale for future reference
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information organized by complexity level

### **LLM-Optimized Structure**
- **Context Boundaries**: Clear scope definitions for each document
- **Cross-References**: Explicit relationships between concepts
- **Pattern Libraries**: Reusable approaches for common tasks
- **Version Control**: Track evolution of patterns and decisions
