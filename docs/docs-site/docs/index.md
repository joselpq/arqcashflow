# ArqCashflow Documentation Hub

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for ArqCashflow - the LLM-agent-optimized financial management system for architects.

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Navigation hub and context map for all documentation
**Prerequisites**: None - this is the entry point
**Key Patterns**:
- Documentation structure patterns
- Audience-specific navigation
- Context-aware document discovery

## Quick Navigation

### üë• **For Users**
New to ArqCashflow? Start here to learn how to manage your architectural business finances.

**[üöÄ Getting Started Guide ‚Üí](./user/getting-started.md)**

Key Topics:
- Account setup and onboarding
- Creating contracts and tracking receivables
- Managing expenses and budgets
- Using AI assistant features
- Exporting reports and data

### ‚ö° **For Developers**
Technical documentation for implementing, extending, and maintaining ArqCashflow.

**[üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup ‚Üí](./developer/setup.md)**

Key Topics:
- Local development environment
- Architecture and system design
- API reference and integration
- **Testing strategies with authenticated test users**
- Database schema and migrations

### ü§ñ **For LLM Agents**
Structured contexts, patterns, and decision records optimized for AI-assisted development.

> **üìç LLM Agent Navigation Guide**:
>
> - **üîß For Current Project Status**: Start with `/LLM_AGENT_GUIDE.md` (project root) for operational context, health protocols, and immediate next steps
> - **üìö For Comprehensive Patterns**: Use [`/docs/agents/llm-agent-guide.md`](./agents/llm-agent-guide.md) for methodologies, pattern libraries, and deep learning
>
> Both guides cross-reference each other to prevent confusion.

**[üéØ Agent Templates ‚Üí](./meta/templates/document-template.md)**

Key Topics:
- Document structure templates
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Development patterns and contexts
- Code examples and best practices
- Decision history and rationale

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation system is designed for **human-AI collaborative development**:

### **Structured Metadata**
Every document includes machine-readable frontmatter with:
- Audience targeting (user/developer/agent/designer)
- Context classification (feature areas, complexity levels)
- Cross-references and dependencies
- Agent role definitions

### **Pattern-Driven Content**
- **Executable Examples**: All code examples are tested and working
- **Decision Traceability**: ADRs preserve why decisions were made
- **Context Preservation**: Background and rationale for future reference
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information organized by complexity level

### **LLM-Optimized Structure**
- **Context Boundaries**: Clear scope definitions for each document
- **Cross-References**: Explicit relationships between concepts
- **Pattern Libraries**: Reusable approaches for common tasks
- **Version Control**: Track evolution of patterns and decisions

## Project Overview

**ArqCashflow** is a Next.js application built for architects to manage:

- **üìù Contracts**: Client agreements and project management
- **üí∞ Receivables**: Payment tracking and cash flow optimization
- **üí∏ Expenses**: Cost management and vendor payments
- **ü§ñ AI Assistant**: Natural language document processing and queries
- **üìä Reporting**: Excel and Google Sheets export capabilities

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
