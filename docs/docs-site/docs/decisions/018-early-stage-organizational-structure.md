# ADR-018: Early-Stage Organizational Structure (3-Team Model)

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Defines ArqCashflow's lean organizational structure optimized for early-stage focus, with 3 core teams aligned to business-critical objectives and clear boundaries
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of AI-first product strategy, vertical market focus (architects), conversational UX differentiation
**Key Patterns**:
- Lean team structure (8-12 people total)
- Clear team boundaries and success metrics
- Aligned incentives to prevent feature bloat and ensure differentiation
- Focus over breadth at early stage

## Status

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision Makers**: Leadership Team
**Context**: Early-stage company focusing on product-market fit in architect vertical

---

## Context

### Problem Statement

**Challenge**: At early stage (pre-PMF or early PMF), traditional organizational structures create misaligned incentives that lead to:
- **Feature bloat**: Teams rewarded for shipping features, not solving user problems
- **Vertical dilution**: Pressure to expand horizontally before owning one market
- **Speed loss**: Too many teams, unclear ownership, slow decision-making
- **AI gimmick risk**: AI becomes marketing checkbox rather than core differentiator

**Critical Question**: How do we structure teams to maximize our AI-first, vertical-focused differentiation while staying lean and moving fast?

### Constraints

**Business Constraints**:
- Limited funding runway (assume 12-18 months)
- Small team size (8-12 people total)
- Need rapid iteration and learning velocity
- Must establish product-market fit before scaling

**Market Constraints**:
- Competitors (QuickBooks, Xero) have massive resources and brand recognition
- Must differentiate clearly to win against incumbents
- Brazilian market requires local expertise and cultural understanding
- Architect vertical is narrow but deep opportunity

**Technical Constraints**:
- Claude API dependency for AI capabilities
- Platform must be reliable and fast for AI-first UX to work
- Onboarding flow is critical competitive advantage (5-min vs weeks)

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Clear ownership of growth, customer success, and AI experience
2. Aligned incentives that reinforce strategic differentiation
3. Minimal overhead and bureaucracy
4. Fast decision-making and experimentation

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
1. Team structure must be sustainable with 8-12 people
2. Success metrics must be measurable and actionable
3. Boundaries must prevent conflicting priorities
4. Culture must support speed and vertical focus

---

## Decision

### What We Decided

**Implement a 3-team organizational structure** optimized for early-stage focus and strategic differentiation:

1. **Growth & Onboarding Team** - Drive acquisition and activation
2. **Vertical Customer Success Team** - Own architect vertical market fit and retention
3. **AI Optimization Team** - Make Arnaldo the best financial assistant in the world

### Rationale

**Why 3 Teams (Not More)**:
- Minimum viable structure to cover critical business functions
- Clear ownership without overlap or gaps
- Small enough for high coordination and speed
- Scales to 12 people without becoming bureaucratic

**Why These 3 Specific Teams**:
1. **Growth & Onboarding**: If users can't discover, try, or activate → we have no business
2. **Vertical Success**: If architects don't love us and refer peers → we have no moat
3. **AI Optimization**: If Arnaldo isn't magical → we're just another accounting tool

**Key Design Principles**:
- Teams aligned to business outcomes, not functions
- Success metrics that reinforce differentiation
- Clear boundaries to prevent scope creep
- Shared responsibility for product quality and user happiness

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Traditional Functional Teams (Engineering, Product, Marketing)

- **Description**: Organize by function rather than business outcome
- **Pros**: Clear career paths, easy to understand, industry standard
- **Cons**: Misaligned incentives, slower decision-making, silo mentality, doesn't reinforce strategic differentiation
- **Why Not Chosen**: At early stage, we need teams aligned to business outcomes, not org chart simplicity

### Option 2: Single Unified Product Team

- **Description**: Everyone works on everything, no team boundaries
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, no silos, easy communication
- **Cons**: Unclear ownership, conflicting priorities, no specialized expertise, hard to scale beyond 5-6 people
- **Why Not Chosen**: Too chaotic for 8-12 people, need clear ownership and accountability

### Option 3: 5+ Specialized Teams (AI, Growth, Success, Platform, Data)

- **Description**: More granular team structure with dedicated platform/data teams
- **Pros**: Clear specialization, scalable structure
- **Cons**: Too much overhead for early stage, slow decision-making, artificial boundaries
- **Why Not Chosen**: Over-engineering for current size; can add teams later as we scale

### Option 4: Hire Agencies/Contractors Instead of Teams

- **Description**: Outsource functions like marketing, customer support, AI development
- **Pros**: Lower fixed costs, access to specialized expertise
- **Cons**: No institutional knowledge, misaligned incentives, slower feedback loops, quality inconsistency
- **Why Not Chosen**: Our differentiation requires deep expertise and fast iteration that agencies can't provide
