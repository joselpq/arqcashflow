# ADR-012: Operations Agent Incremental Rebuild

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Complete rebuild of Operations Agent using incremental development approach
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of Claude API, service layer architecture, conversation state management
**Key Patterns**:
- Start with absolute minimum viable implementation
- Add one capability at a time
- Test thoroughly before adding next feature
- Trust Claude's capabilities, minimize custom code
- Keep code simple and readable

## Status

**ACCEPTED** - 2025-10-02

**Current Implementation**: ✅ Steps 1-3 Complete (2025-10-02)
- Step 1: ✅ Basic conversation with context
- Step 2: ✅ Simple expense creation
- Step 3: ✅ Confirmation workflow (Claude-powered)

**Next Step**: Step 4 - Update and Delete operations

## Problem Statement

### What Went Wrong

The Operations Agent had become over-engineered to **2,049 lines of code** with:

❌ **Over-engineering**:
- Manual state machines for conversation tracking
- Fuzzy matching libraries for entity lookup
- Multi-phase intent classification
- Complex query delegation system
- Extensive custom inference logic

❌ **Still Broken**:
- Could not maintain context across multi-turn conversations
- Confirmation workflow was fragile
- Reference resolution ("o primeiro", "esse contrato") unreliable
- Too much code to debug effectively

❌ **Fighting Claude Instead of Trusting It**:
- Built custom date parsing when Claude can do this naturally
- Created fuzzy matching when Claude can query the database
- Implemented state tracking when Claude can use conversation history
- Added intent classification when Claude can understand naturally

### Root Cause Analysis

**Core Mistake**: We tried to control what Claude does instead of giving it context and letting it decide.

**Example of the Problem**:
```typescript
// WRONG: 330 lines of smart-inference.ts
function parseDate(text: string): string {
  if (text === 'ontem') return yesterday()
  if (text === 'hoje') return today()
  if (text === 'amanhã') return tomorrow()
  // ... 300+ more lines
}

// RIGHT: Just ask Claude
const prompt = `Today is ${today}. Extract the date from "${text}"`
```

## Decision

**Rebuild the Operations Agent incrementally from scratch** following these principles:

### Core Principles

1. **Start Extremely Simple** (~45 lines)
   - Prove conversation context works first
   - No CRUD operations until context is solid

2. **Add One Capability at a Time**
   - Each step builds on previous steps
   - Test thoroughly before moving forward
   - Never break what already works

3. **Trust Claude, Not Code**
   - Give Claude full context (conversation, schema, current date)
   - Let Claude make decisions (dates, categories, entities)
   - Minimize custom logic between user and Claude

4. **Keep It Simple**
   - Resist the urge to add "nice to have" features
   - Every line of code must justify its existence
   - If Claude can do it, don't code it

### Implementation Strategy: 10-Step Roadmap

#### ✅ **Step 1: Conversation Context** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Prove Claude can remember conversation history

**Implementation**: 45 lines total
```typescript
class OperationsAgentService {
  async processCommand(message: string, history: ConversationMessage[] = []) {
    const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 1000,
      system: 'Você é um assistente financeiro. Seja amigável e mostre que lembra do contexto.',
      messages: [...history, { role: 'user', content: message }]
    })

    return {
      success: true,
      message: content.text,
      conversationHistory: [...history, userMsg, assistantMsg]
    }
  }
}
```

**What It Has**:
- ✅ Conversation history (all previous messages)
- ✅ Team context (teamId, userId from ServiceContext)
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4 integration

**What It Does NOT Have** (yet):
- ❌ CRUD operations
- ❌ Database access
- ❌ Entity tracking
- ❌ Confirmations
- ❌ Query Agent integration

**System Prompt**: `"Você é um assistente financeiro. Seja amigável e mostre que lembra do contexto."`

**Testing**: Works in "AI Unificado" tab at `/ai-chat`

**Success Criteria**: ✅
- User can have multi-turn conversation
- Claude remembers previous messages
- No crashes or errors

---

#### ✅ **Step 2: Simple Expense Creation** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Add ability to create expenses from natural language

**Implementation**: ~150 lines total (final with Step 3)

**What Was Added**:
- ✅ Enhanced system prompt with database schema for expenses
- ✅ ExpenseService integration
- ✅ JSON-based action extraction
- ✅ Date inference (ontem, hoje, amanhã)
- ✅ Category inference from description
- ✅ Amount parsing (R$50, 50 reais, etc.)

**Key Decision**: Let Claude handle everything through conversation context
- No manual state tracking
- No separate confirmation detection methods
- Single system prompt with full workflow instructions

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All passed
- "R$50 em gasolina" → Creates expense
- "R$30 em almoço ontem" → Creates expense with yesterday's date
- Conversation context maintained for non-expense messages

---

#### ✅ **Step 3: Confirmation Workflow** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Preview and confirm before creating

**Final Implementation**: ~150 lines (integrated with Step 2)

**What Was Added**:
- ✅ System prompt includes full workflow: preview → confirm → create
- ✅ Claude handles confirmation detection naturally (no hardcoded words)
- ✅ Preview format with emojis (📝 💰 📅 🏷️)
- ✅ Cancellation support
- ✅ JSON extraction handles text before/after JSON

**Key Innovation**: **No separate state management**
- Removed `PendingOperation` interface entirely
- Removed `pendingOperation` parameter
- Claude uses conversation history to know context
- Claude decides when to preview vs when to create

**Workflow**:
1. User: "R$50 em gasolina"
2. Claude: Shows preview "Vou criar uma despesa: ... Confirma?"
3. User: "sim" (or "ok", "pode", "vai", etc.)
4. Claude: Returns `{"action": "create_expense", ...}`
5. Service: Creates expense

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All passed
- Shows preview before creating
- Confirms on "sim", "ok", "pode", "vai lá", etc.
- Cancels on "não", "cancela", etc.
- Can start new conversation while preview is shown

---

#### 📋 **Step 4: Update and Delete Expenses**

**Goal**: Modify and remove expenses

**What to Add**:
- Update operation handling
- Delete operation handling
- Query Agent integration for finding expenses

**Success Criteria**:
- "Atualiza a despesa de gasolina para R$60" → Updates
- "Deleta a despesa de almoço" → Deletes after confirmation

---

#### 📋 **Step 5: Contracts and Receivables**

**Goal**: Expand to other entity types

**What to Add**:
- ContractService integration
- ReceivableService integration
- Enhanced schema in system prompt

---

#### 📋 **Step 6: Batch Operations**

**Goal**: Handle multiple entities at once

**What to Add**:
- Batch create detection
- Date progression logic
- Batch preview and confirmation

---

#### 📋 **Step 7: Advanced Context**

**Goal**: Entity tracking and reference resolution

**What to Add**:
- Track recently created entities
- Reference resolution ("o primeiro", "esse contrato")
- Multi-match handling

---

#### 📋 **Step 8: Query Agent Integration**

**Goal**: Delegate read queries

**What to Add**:
- Intent detection (query vs operation)
- FinancialQueryService integration

---

#### 📋 **Step 9: Setup Assistant Integration**

**Goal**: Handle document uploads

**What to Add**:
- File upload detection
- Setup Assistant routing

---

#### 📋 **Step 10: Polish and Production**

**Goal**: Production-ready features

**What to Add**:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting
- Performance optimization
- User feedback mechanisms

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Dramatically Simpler**: 45 lines vs 2,049 lines
✅ **Actually Works**: Conversation context proven functional
✅ **Easier to Debug**: Can understand entire codebase at once
✅ **Faster to Extend**: Clear path for adding capabilities
✅ **Trust in Claude**: Leverage AI capabilities instead of fighting them
✅ **Testable**: Each step has clear success criteria
✅ **Safe**: Never break previous steps

### Negative

⚠️ **Slower Initial Progress**: Must implement features one at a time
⚠️ **Requires Discipline**: Temptation to add features before testing
⚠️ **More Iterations**: May discover issues requiring backtracking

### Neutral

🔄 **Learning Process**: Each step teaches us what Claude can/can't do
🔄 **Flexible**: Can adjust roadmap based on what we learn

## Implementation Notes

### Current Files

**Core Implementation** (45 lines):
- `lib/services/OperationsAgentService.ts` - Minimal service
- `app/api/ai/operations/route.ts` - Simple API endpoint

**UI Integration**:
- `app/ai-chat/enhanced-page.tsx` - "AI Unificado" tab calls Operations directly (no router)

**Documentation**:
- `OPERATIONS-AGENT-ROADMAP.md` - Complete 10-step plan
- `OPERATIONS-AGENT-STEP1-COMPLETE.md` - Step 1 testing guide

### Testing Strategy

Each step must have:
1. ✅ Clear success criteria
2. ✅ Manual testing in browser (AI Unificado tab)
3. ✅ Test script (optional but recommended)
4. ✅ Documentation of what works

### Router Integration

**Current State**: AI Unificado tab calls Operations Agent directly

**Future**: Once Operations Agent has more capabilities (Step 5+), we can:
- Option A: Keep direct integration (simpler)
- Option B: Re-introduce router for multi-agent coordination

**Decision**: Deferred until Step 5 complete

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fix the Existing 2,049-Line Implementation

**Rejected** because:
- Code was too complex to debug effectively
- Unclear which parts were necessary vs over-engineered
- Would take longer to fix than rebuild
- No guarantee fixes would work

### Alternative 2: Build All Features at Once

**Rejected** because:
- Previous approach proved this doesn't work
- Can't test intermediate states
- High risk of over-engineering again
- Harder to identify what's essential

### Alternative 3: Use a Different AI Model

**Rejected** because:
- Problem wasn't the model (Claude Sonnet 4 is excellent)
- Problem was our architecture fighting the model
- Changing models doesn't address root cause
