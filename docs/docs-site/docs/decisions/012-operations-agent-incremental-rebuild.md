# ADR-012: Operations Agent Incremental Rebuild

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Complete rebuild of Operations Agent using incremental development approach
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of Claude API, service layer architecture, conversation state management
**Key Patterns**:
- Start with absolute minimum viable implementation
- Add one capability at a time
- Test thoroughly before adding next feature
- Trust Claude's capabilities, minimize custom code
- Keep code simple and readable

## Status

**ACCEPTED** - 2025-10-02
**UPDATED** - 2025-10-03

**Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ Steps 1-5 Complete (2025-10-03)
- Step 1: ‚úÖ Basic conversation with context
- Step 2: ‚úÖ Simple expense creation
- Step 3: ‚úÖ Confirmation workflow (Claude-powered)
- Step 4: ‚úÖ Update and Delete operations (with bulkUpdate API integration)
- Step 5: ‚úÖ Multi-entity support (Contract, Receivable, RecurringExpense)

**Current Status**: All entity types supported, production bugs fixed, max_tokens optimized

**Next Steps**: Step 6+ - Batch operations, advanced context, agent integration

## Problem Statement

### What Went Wrong

The Operations Agent had become over-engineered to **2,049 lines of code** with:

‚ùå **Over-engineering**:
- Manual state machines for conversation tracking
- Fuzzy matching libraries for entity lookup
- Multi-phase intent classification
- Complex query delegation system
- Extensive custom inference logic

‚ùå **Still Broken**:
- Could not maintain context across multi-turn conversations
- Confirmation workflow was fragile
- Reference resolution ("o primeiro", "esse contrato") unreliable
- Too much code to debug effectively

‚ùå **Fighting Claude Instead of Trusting It**:
- Built custom date parsing when Claude can do this naturally
- Created fuzzy matching when Claude can query the database
- Implemented state tracking when Claude can use conversation history
- Added intent classification when Claude can understand naturally

### Root Cause Analysis

**Core Mistake**: We tried to control what Claude does instead of giving it context and letting it decide.

**Example of the Problem**:
```typescript
// WRONG: 330 lines of smart-inference.ts
function parseDate(text: string): string {
  if (text === 'ontem') return yesterday()
  if (text === 'hoje') return today()
  if (text === 'amanh√£') return tomorrow()
  // ... 300+ more lines
}

// RIGHT: Just ask Claude
const prompt = `Today is ${today}. Extract the date from "${text}"`
```

## Decision

**Rebuild the Operations Agent incrementally from scratch** following these principles:

### Core Principles

1. **Start Extremely Simple** (~45 lines)
   - Prove conversation context works first
   - No CRUD operations until context is solid

2. **Add One Capability at a Time**
   - Each step builds on previous steps
   - Test thoroughly before moving forward
   - Never break what already works

3. **Trust Claude, Not Code**
   - Give Claude full context (conversation, schema, current date)
   - Let Claude make decisions (dates, categories, entities)
   - Minimize custom logic between user and Claude

4. **Keep It Simple**
   - Resist the urge to add "nice to have" features
   - Every line of code must justify its existence
   - If Claude can do it, don't code it

### Implementation Strategy: 10-Step Roadmap

#### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Conversation Context** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Prove Claude can remember conversation history

**Implementation**: 45 lines total
```typescript
class OperationsAgentService {
  async processCommand(message: string, history: ConversationMessage[] = []) {
    const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 1000,
      system: 'Voc√™ √© um assistente financeiro. Seja amig√°vel e mostre que lembra do contexto.',
      messages: [...history, { role: 'user', content: message }]
    })

    return {
      success: true,
      message: content.text,
      conversationHistory: [...history, userMsg, assistantMsg]
    }
  }
}
```

**What It Has**:
- ‚úÖ Conversation history (all previous messages)
- ‚úÖ Team context (teamId, userId from ServiceContext)
- ‚úÖ Claude Sonnet 4 integration

**What It Does NOT Have** (yet):
- ‚ùå CRUD operations
- ‚ùå Database access
- ‚ùå Entity tracking
- ‚ùå Confirmations
- ‚ùå Query Agent integration

**System Prompt**: `"Voc√™ √© um assistente financeiro. Seja amig√°vel e mostre que lembra do contexto."`

**Testing**: Works in "AI Unificado" tab at `/ai-chat`

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ
- User can have multi-turn conversation
- Claude remembers previous messages
- No crashes or errors

---

#### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Simple Expense Creation** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Add ability to create expenses from natural language

**Implementation**: ~150 lines total (final with Step 3)

**What Was Added**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced system prompt with database schema for expenses
- ‚úÖ ExpenseService integration
- ‚úÖ JSON-based action extraction
- ‚úÖ Date inference (ontem, hoje, amanh√£)
- ‚úÖ Category inference from description
- ‚úÖ Amount parsing (R$50, 50 reais, etc.)

**Key Decision**: Let Claude handle everything through conversation context
- No manual state tracking
- No separate confirmation detection methods
- Single system prompt with full workflow instructions

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ All passed
- "R$50 em gasolina" ‚Üí Creates expense
- "R$30 em almo√ßo ontem" ‚Üí Creates expense with yesterday's date
- Conversation context maintained for non-expense messages

---

#### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Confirmation Workflow** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-02)

**Goal**: Preview and confirm before creating

**Final Implementation**: ~150 lines (integrated with Step 2)

**What Was Added**:
- ‚úÖ System prompt includes full workflow: preview ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí create
- ‚úÖ Claude handles confirmation detection naturally (no hardcoded words)
- ‚úÖ Preview format with emojis (üìù üí∞ üìÖ üè∑Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Cancellation support
- ‚úÖ JSON extraction handles text before/after JSON

**Key Innovation**: **No separate state management**
- Removed `PendingOperation` interface entirely
- Removed `pendingOperation` parameter
- Claude uses conversation history to know context
- Claude decides when to preview vs when to create

**Workflow**:
1. User: "R$50 em gasolina"
2. Claude: Shows preview "Vou criar uma despesa: ... Confirma?"
3. User: "sim" (or "ok", "pode", "vai", etc.)
4. Claude: Returns `{"action": "create_expense", ...}`
5. Service: Creates expense

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ All passed
- Shows preview before creating
- Confirms on "sim", "ok", "pode", "vai l√°", etc.
- Cancels on "n√£o", "cancela", etc.
- Can start new conversation while preview is shown

---

#### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Update and Delete Expenses** (COMPLETE - 2025-01-03)

**Goal**: Modify and remove expenses using native bulk APIs

**Implementation**: ~650 lines total (including comprehensive system prompt + bug fixes)

**What Was Added**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced system prompt with full database schema (4 tables)
- ‚úÖ Complete API documentation (all CRUD + bulkCreate/bulkUpdate/bulkDelete)
- ‚úÖ Multi-JSON parser for batch operations
- ‚úÖ Native bulk API integration (using BaseService bulk methods)
- ‚úÖ Tool use format parser (handles Claude's XML-like output)
- ‚úÖ Smart update params handling (flexible format support)
- ‚úÖ Conversation history preservation (query results retained)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL case sensitivity handling
- ‚úÖ Display vs context history separation

**Key Discoveries & Bug Fixes**:

1. **Bug 1: Missing Bulk Operations** (Fixed 2025-01-03)
   - Problem: Only had bulkUpdate, missing bulkCreate and bulkDelete
   - Solution: Added bulkCreate(items) and bulkDelete(ids) to all services
   - Impact: Can now delete multiple items at once

2. **Bug 2: PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity** (Fixed 2025-01-03)
   - Problem: Query failed with "column duedate does not exist"
   - Root cause: PostgreSQL requires quoted column names
   - Solution: Added explicit rule to ALWAYS quote columns in queries
   - Example: SELECT "id", "dueDate" FROM "Expense"

3. **Bug 3: Display vs Context History** (Fixed 2025-01-03)
   - Problem: Users saw raw [QUERY_RESULTS] JSON in chat
   - Secondary problem: ID hallucination when query results filtered out
   - Root cause: Frontend sent displayHistory back as conversationHistory
   - Solution: Dual history tracking
     - **conversationHistory**: Full context with internal messages (for Claude)
     - **displayHistory**: User-facing only (for UI)
     - **Frontend**: Maintains separate `fullHistory` and `messages` states

**Architecture Evolution**:

**Initial Approach** (Step 4 start):
```typescript
conversationHistory ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Backend
                   ‚Üì
          Single history for both display and context
```

**Final Approach** (Step 4 complete):
```typescript
Backend returns:
  conversationHistory (full with [QUERY_RESULTS])
  displayHistory (filtered for user)

Frontend maintains:
  fullHistory (send to backend - preserves Claude context)
  messages (render to UI - clean display)
```

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ All passed (production tested)
- "Quais minhas 3 menores despesas com Notion?" ‚Üí Formatted response (no raw JSON)
- "Pode alterar para R$25?" ‚Üí Shows preview using correct IDs from query
- "Pode" ‚Üí Executes bulkUpdate with real IDs (no hallucination)
- PostgreSQL queries work with complex filters
- Bulk delete works for multiple items

**Technical Solutions**:

1. **Comprehensive System Prompt** (lines 39-300 in OperationsAgentService.ts):
   - Database schema for all 4 entity types with field types
   - API method signatures: create, bulkCreate, update, bulkUpdate, delete, bulkDelete
   - PostgreSQL case sensitivity rules with examples
   - Inference guidelines (dates, categories, amounts)
   - Workflow instructions (query ‚Üí preview ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí execute)
   - Critical rule: ALWAYS include 'id' in SELECT queries
   - Explicit examples of correct vs incorrect action output

2. **Multi-JSON Parser** (lines 340-400):
   - Brace-counting algorithm for nested JSON extraction
   - Converts multiple update/delete actions to single bulk call
   - Handles both tool use format and inline JSON

3. **Dual History Architecture**:
   - Backend: `filterInternalMessages()` helper (lines 31-41)
   - Backend: All return statements include both histories
   - Frontend: Separate `fullHistory` (context) and `messages` (display)
   - Frontend: Sends fullHistory to API, displays messages to user

**Architecture Decisions**:
- ‚úÖ Chose native bulk APIs over custom batching
- ‚úÖ Trust Claude with minimal code (system prompt > custom logic)
- ‚úÖ Preserve query results in conversation (not server-side state)
- ‚úÖ Separate display from context (clean architecture principle)
- ‚úÖ Filter internal messages on backend (frontend shouldn't know format)

**Performance**: ~650 lines (vs 2,049 in original) - **68% reduction**

---

#### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Multi-Entity Support** (COMPLETE - 2025-10-03)

**Goal**: Expand to all entity types (Contract, Receivable, RecurringExpense)

**Implementation**: ~650 lines maintained (no code bloat)

**What Was Added**:
- ‚úÖ ContractService integration with deletion options
- ‚úÖ ReceivableService integration
- ‚úÖ RecurringExpenseService integration
- ‚úÖ Complete schema documentation for all 4 entities in system prompt
- ‚úÖ Smart defaults for dates and contract fields
- ‚úÖ Contract deletion UX with receivables handling options

**Bug Fixes (Production Testing)**:

**Bug 1: RecurringExpense Schema** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Problem: System prompt documented wrong schema (had `dueDate`, actual is `nextDue`)
- Solution: Updated schema to show correct fields (nextDue, isActive, vendor)
- Added warning: "RecurringExpense N√ÉO tem campo 'dueDate'!"

**Bug 2: Contract Deletion Missing Receivables Handling** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Problem: Claude deleted contracts without asking about linked receivables
- Solution: Added `options` parameter documentation with two modes:
  - `"contract-only"`: Unlinks receivables (safe default)
  - `"contract-and-receivables"`: Deletes everything (destructive)
- Added workflow rule requiring Claude to always ask user about receivables

**Bug 3: JSON Exposure in User Display** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Problem: Claude echoed `[QUERY_RESULTS]` and `{action:...}` JSON in responses
- Solution: Enhanced system prompt with explicit rules:
  - Line 115: "NUNCA inclua '[QUERY_RESULTS]' ou '{action:...}' na resposta"
  - Line 321: Preview must be "em linguagem natural, NUNCA mostre JSON"

**Bug 4: max_tokens Limit for Large Operations** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Problem: 1,500 token limit caused truncated JSON for 108 contract IDs
- Evidence: Response stopped mid-JSON at ID #73, system couldn't parse action
- Analysis: 108 IDs = ~2,700 chars + structure + text = ~2,500 tokens needed
- Solution: Increased max_tokens to **8,192** (supports ~400 IDs)

**max_tokens Decision Rationale**:

**Why 8,192?**
1. ‚úÖ Handles realistic bulk operations (up to ~400 contract IDs)
2. ‚úÖ Avoids Anthropic SDK timeout warning (>10 min for non-streaming)
3. ‚úÖ Cost-efficient (only pay for tokens actually used, not the limit)
4. ‚úÖ 5x increase from original 1,500, covers 99% of use cases

**SDK Constraint**:
- Anthropic TypeScript SDK has `calculateNonstreamingTimeout` check
- Non-streaming requests with max_tokens >~16K trigger 10-minute timeout error
- Error: "Streaming is required for operations that may take longer than 10 minutes"
- Tested: 32K triggers warning, 8K does not

**Future Scaling (if needed)**:
- Claude Sonnet 4 supports up to **64,000 max_tokens**
- To use >16K without warnings, add `timeout: 600000` (10 min) to API calls
- Or enable streaming: `stream: true` (requires response handling changes)
- For >1,000 IDs: Consider "useLastQueryResults" pattern (reference IDs from history)

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/OperationsAgentService.ts` (lines 360, 523)

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ All passed
- "Cria um contrato da Mari de R$5000" ‚Üí Creates contract
- "Deleta o contrato Ble" ‚Üí Asks about receivables, then deletes
- "Lista despesas recorrentes" ‚Üí Uses correct schema fields
- 108 contract bulk deletion ‚Üí Complete JSON response, successful execution

## Consequences

### Positive

‚úÖ **Dramatically Simpler**: 45 lines vs 2,049 lines
‚úÖ **Actually Works**: Conversation context proven functional
‚úÖ **Easier to Debug**: Can understand entire codebase at once
‚úÖ **Faster to Extend**: Clear path for adding capabilities
‚úÖ **Trust in Claude**: Leverage AI capabilities instead of fighting them
‚úÖ **Testable**: Each step has clear success criteria
‚úÖ **Safe**: Never break previous steps

### Negative

‚ö†Ô∏è **Slower Initial Progress**: Must implement features one at a time
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Discipline**: Temptation to add features before testing
‚ö†Ô∏è **More Iterations**: May discover issues requiring backtracking

### Neutral

üîÑ **Learning Process**: Each step teaches us what Claude can/can't do
üîÑ **Flexible**: Can adjust roadmap based on what we learn

## Implementation Notes

### Current Files

**Core Implementation** (45 lines):
- `lib/services/OperationsAgentService.ts` - Minimal service
- `app/api/ai/operations/route.ts` - Simple API endpoint

**UI Integration**:
- `app/ai-chat/enhanced-page.tsx` - "AI Unificado" tab calls Operations directly (no router)

**Documentation**:
- `OPERATIONS-AGENT-ROADMAP.md` - Complete 10-step plan
- `OPERATIONS-AGENT-STEP1-COMPLETE.md` - Step 1 testing guide

### Testing Strategy

Each step must have:
1. ‚úÖ Clear success criteria
2. ‚úÖ Manual testing in browser (AI Unificado tab)
3. ‚úÖ Test script (optional but recommended)
4. ‚úÖ Documentation of what works

### Router Integration

**Current State**: AI Unificado tab calls Operations Agent directly

**Future**: Once Operations Agent has more capabilities (Step 5+), we can:
- Option A: Keep direct integration (simpler)
- Option B: Re-introduce router for multi-agent coordination

**Decision**: Deferred until Step 5 complete

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fix the Existing 2,049-Line Implementation

**Rejected** because:
- Code was too complex to debug effectively
- Unclear which parts were necessary vs over-engineered
- Would take longer to fix than rebuild
- No guarantee fixes would work

### Alternative 2: Build All Features at Once

**Rejected** because:
- Previous approach proved this doesn't work
- Can't test intermediate states
- High risk of over-engineering again
- Harder to identify what's essential

### Alternative 3: Use a Different AI Model

**Rejected** because:
- Problem wasn't the model (Claude Sonnet 4 is excellent)
- Problem was our architecture fighting the model
- Changing models doesn't address root cause

## References

- **Original Problem**: Operations Agent at 2,049 lines, broken context handling
- **Inspiration**: Financial Query Agent success with minimal implementation (288 lines, working perfectly)
- **ADR-008**: AI Agent Strategy (original Operations Agent design)
- **OPERATIONS-AGENT-ROADMAP.md**: Complete 10-step incremental plan

## Success Metrics

### Step 1 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds
- ‚úÖ Conversation context works in browser
- ‚úÖ No crashes or errors
- ‚úÖ Code is readable and maintainable

### Overall Project Success (All Steps Complete)

- üéØ All features from original spec working

## Lessons Learned

### What We Learned

1. **Start Simple Always Wins**: 45 working lines > 2,049 broken lines
2. **Trust AI Capabilities**: Claude can do date parsing, entity matching, intent classification
3. **Conversation History Is Powerful**: Simpler than custom state machines
4. **Test Immediately**: Don't build more until current step works
5. **Resist Feature Creep**: Every "nice to have" adds complexity

### What We'll Apply Going Forward

1. ‚úÖ **One capability at a time** - No exceptions
2. ‚úÖ **Test before extending** - Each step must work perfectly
3. ‚úÖ **Trust Claude** - If Claude can do it, don't code it
4. ‚úÖ **Keep prompts simple** - Add context, not instructions
5. ‚úÖ **Document as we go** - Each step gets documentation
