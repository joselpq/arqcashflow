# AI Agent Strategy: Specialized Financial Intelligence Architecture

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Comprehensive AI agent strategy for ArqCashflow, defining specialized agents for financial intelligence, document processing, and business insights
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of service layer architecture, event system, and financial business domain
**Key Patterns**:
- Specialized agents over generalist approaches
- Native multimodal capabilities (images, documents, spreadsheets)
- Business context-aware reasoning
- API-driven integration with platform services
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

## 🎯 **Strategic Overview**

ArqCashflow's AI strategy focuses on creating **specialized financial intelligence agents** that transform the user experience from "manual financial management" to "AI-powered financial insights." Each agent has a specific purpose, deep business context, and access to relevant platform APIs.

### **Target User Profile**
- **Primary**: Individual professionals and small service firms (2-10 people)
- **Initial Focus**: Architecture firms as pilot market, expanding to consultants, designers, agencies
- **Pain Point**: Currently using spreadsheets for financial management
- **Goal**: Professional financial system with AI-powered insights
- **Success Metric**: "Wow, this is like having a CFO who never sleeps"

## 🧠 **Core AI Principles**

### **1. Leverage Native LLM Capabilities**
- **No redundant preprocessing**: If Claude can read images/documents natively, don't build OCR
- **Multimodal by default**: Agents should handle images, PDFs, spreadsheets directly
- **Natural reasoning**: Let models use their reasoning capabilities rather than over-constraining

### **2. Optimize for Experience, Not Cost**
- **Best models available**: Prioritize latest/best models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.)
- **Context maximization**: Use full context windows when beneficial
- **Quality over efficiency**: Better user experience over cost optimization

### **3. Specialization Over Generalization**
- **Purpose-built agents**: Each agent has specific expertise and tools
- **Deep business context**: Agents understand architecture firms' financial patterns
- **Focused tool sets**: Only relevant APIs and capabilities per agent

### **4. Context-Rich, Not Prescriptive**
- **Business context**: Full understanding of user's business model and goals
- **Flexible guidance**: Clear objectives with reasoning freedom
- **Self-correcting**: Agents should validate their own outputs

### **5. API-Native Integration**
- **Service layer integration**: Direct API access to platform services
- **Event-driven coordination**: Use event system for inter-agent communication
- **Team-aware**: All agents respect team isolation and security

## 🏗️ **Architecture Integration Strategy**

### **Compliance with Existing Patterns**
Our agent implementation fully leverages the existing architectural foundation:

#### **Service Layer Integration**
- **Pattern**: Agents extend `BaseService` for consistent team-scoped operations
- **Security**: All agents use `withTeamContext` middleware for team isolation
- **Audit Trail**: Automatic audit logging through existing `auditCreate`, `auditUpdate`, `auditDelete`
- **Validation**: Leverage existing `BaseFieldSchemas` and `EnumSchemas`

#### **Team Context Middleware**
```typescript
// All agent operations respect team boundaries
withTeamContext(async (context) => {
  const onboardingAgent = new OnboardingIntelligenceAgent(context)
  return await onboardingAgent.processDocuments(files, teamId)
})
```

#### **Validation Schema Reuse**
```typescript
// Agent requests validate using existing schemas
const documentRequest = z.object({
  files: z.array(FileSchemas.uploadedFile),
  teamId: BaseFieldSchemas.teamId,
  extractionType: EnumSchemas.documentType
})
```

#### **Service Dependencies**
```typescript
// Agents use existing services, no duplication
class OnboardingIntelligenceAgent extends BaseService {
  private contractService: ContractService
  private expenseService: ExpenseService
  private receivableService: ReceivableService

  // Leverages existing CRUD operations, bulk operations, validation
}
```

### **Implementation Philosophy**
1. **No Reinvention**: Use existing service patterns, don't rebuild
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: Enhance current capabilities, don't replace
3. **Backward Compatibility**: New agents integrate with existing UI and APIs
4. **Security First**: Team isolation and audit logging from day one

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Challenges**

### **File Type Processing Issues**

#### **Excel Files (.xlsx)**
- **Issue**: Claude Vision API receives base64 but can't interpret Excel structure
- **Solution Options**:
  1. Parse XLSX to JSON/CSV before sending to Claude
  2. Use specialized XLSX library (e.g., xlsx, exceljs)
  3. Convert to CSV format internally before processing

#### **PDF Files**
- **Issue**: Large PDFs (4MB+) may exceed token limits or contain non-text content
- **Solution Options**:
  1. Extract text using PDF parsing library (pdf-parse, pdfjs)
  2. Split multi-page PDFs and process page by page
  3. Use OCR for image-based PDFs

### **Interactive Clarification Design**

```typescript
interface ClarificationRequest {
  missingFields: {
    entity: string
    field: string
    reason: string
    suggestions?: string[]
  }[]
  ambiguousData: {
    entity: string
    field: string
    currentValue: any
    possibleInterpretations: any[]
  }[]
}
```
