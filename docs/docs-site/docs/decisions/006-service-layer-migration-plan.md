# Service Layer Migration Implementation Plan

## Context for LLM Agents

**Scope**: Complete implementation plan for migrating API routes to use the extracted service layer
**Prerequisites**: Service layer extraction completed, team context middleware operational, 100% validation success rate
**Key Patterns**:
- Gradual migration strategy with rollback capabilities
- Service-first architecture with clean business logic separation
- Backwards-compatible implementation during transition
- Risk mitigation through parallel routes and feature flags

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
- Service layer: 100% validated and tested
- Business rules: All enforced correctly
- Team isolation: Verified across all services
- Performance: No degradation detected

## Decision Summary

**Decision**: Proceed with service layer migration using a phased approach
**Status**: Accepted (2025-09-23)
**Validation**: 100% success rate across all service operations

### Services Ready for Migration
1. **ContractService** - 100% validated, comprehensive business logic
2. **ReceivableService** - 100% validated, handles contract & standalone receivables
3. **ExpenseService** - 100% validated, supports one-time & recurring expenses

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept Integration (Week 1)
**Goal**: Integrate ContractService with existing API to validate production approach

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Update contracts API route to use service internally
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withTeamContext(async (context) => {
    const contractService = new ContractService(context)
    const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams

    const filters = {
      status: searchParams.get('status'),
      category: searchParams.get('category'),
      clientName: searchParams.get('clientName')
    }

    const options = {
      sortBy: searchParams.get('sortBy') || 'createdAt',
      sortOrder: searchParams.get('sortOrder') || 'desc'
    }

    return await contractService.findMany(filters, options)
  })
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Identical API responses between old and new implementation
- ✅ No performance degradation (< 10% difference)
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Audit logs maintain consistency
- ✅ Frontend compatibility maintained

### Phase 2: Full Contract API Migration (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Migrate all contract endpoints to use ContractService

**Migration Order** (Risk-based):
1. `GET /api/contracts` - Read operations (lowest risk)
2. `POST /api/contracts` - Create operations
3. `PUT /api/contracts/[id]` - Update operations
4. `DELETE /api/contracts/[id]` - Delete operations (highest risk)

**Code Reduction Expected**: 60% reduction in API route code

### Phase 3: Receivables & Expenses Migration (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Extend migration to remaining core services

**Order**:
1. **ReceivableService** - Similar patterns to contracts
2. **ExpenseService** - More complex due to recurring operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Service Features (Week 6)
**Goal**: Leverage service layer for enhanced capabilities

**New Capabilities**:
- **Bulk operations**: Create multiple entities atomically
- **Cross-entity search**: Unified search across all entities
- **AI integration endpoints**: Services ready for Claude API
- **Advanced reporting**: Consolidated summaries
- **Data export**: Unified export functionality

## Safety & Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Environment flags**: `USE_SERVICE_LAYER=true|false`
2. **Parallel routes**: Keep original implementations during migration
3. **Instant rollback**: < 5 minutes to revert to previous implementation
4. **Real-time monitoring**: Error tracking with automatic alerts

### Testing Protocol
1. **Pre-migration validation**: 100% service test success required
2. **A/B testing**: Compare service vs. direct implementation
3. **Load testing**: Validate performance under realistic load
4. **Integration testing**: End-to-end API + frontend validation

### Abort Criteria
**Stop migration immediately if**:
- Error rate increases > 5%
- Response time increases > 20%
- Data integrity issues detected
- Audit logging failures
- Critical user-reported issues

## Expected Benefits

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
- **60% code reduction** in API routes
- **Centralized business logic** - single source of truth
- **Improved testability** - services independently testable
- **Consistent error handling** across all endpoints

### Medium Term (Month 1-2)
- **AI integration ready** - clean interfaces for Claude API
- **Enhanced features** - bulk operations, cross-entity search
- **Better performance** - optimized queries, reduced DB calls
- **Stronger security** - business rules enforced consistently

### Long Term (Month 3+)
- **50% faster development** - new features easier to implement
- **Reduced bug count** - centralized logic reduces errors
- **Better scalability** - services optimized independently
- **Future flexibility** - easy to add GraphQL, gRPC, etc.
