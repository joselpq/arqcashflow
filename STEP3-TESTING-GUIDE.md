# Step 3: Confirmation Workflow - Testing Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Ready for testing

## What's New in Step 3

✅ **Confirmation Before Creating**: Now shows preview and asks for confirmation
✅ **Pending Operation State**: Tracks operation waiting for approval
✅ **Confirmation Handling**: Recognizes "sim", "não", and variations
✅ **Cancellation**: Can reject operations with "não"
✅ **Preview Format**: Beautiful formatted preview with emojis
✅ **Context Maintained**: Can start new conversation while pending

**Total Lines of Code**: ~262 lines (up from 138)

## New Flow

**Before (Step 2)**:
```
User: "R$50 em gasolina"
Agent: "✅ Despesa criada com sucesso!" [CREATES IMMEDIATELY]
```

**Now (Step 3)**:
```
User: "R$50 em gasolina"
Agent: "Vou criar uma despesa:
       📝 gasolina
       💰 R$ 50.00
       📅 02/10/2025
       🏷️ Transporte
       Confirma? (responda 'sim' ou 'não')"

User: "sim"
Agent: "✅ Despesa criada com sucesso!
       📝 gasolina
       💰 R$ 50.00
       📅 02/10/2025
       🏷️ Transporte"
```

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Confirmation Flow

**Test**: Create expense and confirm
```
User: R$50 em gasolina
Expected: Shows preview, asks for confirmation

User: sim
Expected: Creates expense, shows success message
```

### 2. Rejection Flow

**Test**: Create expense and reject
```
User: R$30 em almoço
Expected: Shows preview, asks for confirmation

User: não
Expected: Shows "❌ Operação cancelada."
```

### 3. Confirmation Variations

**Test**: Different ways to confirm
```
User: R$25 em uber
Expected: Shows preview

Try each:
- "sim" ✅
- "yes" ✅
- "ok" ✅
- "confirma" ✅
- "pode" ✅
- "vai" ✅
- "beleza" ✅
- "show" ✅
```

### 4. Rejection Variations

**Test**: Different ways to reject
```
User: R$100 em material
Expected: Shows preview

Try each:
- "não" ✅
- "nao" ✅
- "no" ✅
- "cancela" ✅
- "para" ✅
```

### 5. Ignore Pending and Start New Conversation

**Test**: Pending operation doesn't block conversation
```
User: R$50 em gasolina
Expected: Shows preview, asks confirmation

User: Oi, tudo bem?
Expected: Responds normally (treats as new conversation, not confirmation)
```

### 6. Multiple Expenses in Sequence

**Test**: Confirm one, then create another
```
User: R$50 em gasolina
Expected: Shows preview

User: sim
Expected: Creates expense

User: R$30 em almoço
Expected: Shows NEW preview for lunch expense

User: sim
Expected: Creates second expense
```

### 7. Preview with Notes

**Test**: Expense with additional notes (if Claude extracts it)
```
User: R$50 em gasolina do posto Shell
Expected: Preview might include notes about "posto Shell"
```

### 8. Date Variations in Preview

**Test**: Check date parsing in preview
```
User: R$50 em gasolina ontem
Expected: Preview shows yesterday's date

User: sim
Expected: Creates with correct date
```

## Expected Preview Format

When requesting expense creation:
```
Vou criar uma despesa:

📝 [description]
💰 R$ [amount]
📅 [date in PT-BR format]
🏷️ [category]
📌 [notes if any]

Confirma? (responda "sim" ou "não")
```

## Expected Success Format

After confirmation:
```
✅ Despesa criada com sucesso!

📝 [description]
💰 R$ [amount]
📅 [date in PT-BR format]
🏷️ [category]
```

## Expected Cancellation Format

After rejection:
```
❌ Operação cancelada.
```

## Implementation Details

**Pending Operation Structure**:
```typescript
{
  type: 'create_expense',
  data: {
    description: string,
    amount: number,
    dueDate: string,
    category: string,
    notes?: string
  },
  preview: string
}
```

**Confirmation Words** (case-insensitive):
- sim, yes, s, y, ok, confirma, confirmar
- pode, vai, faz, fazer, certo, correto
- isso, exato, perfeito, beleza, show

**Rejection Words** (case-insensitive):
- não, nao, no, n, cancela, cancelar
- nope, nunca, jamais, para, parar, stop

## Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:
- [ ] Preview shows before creating
- [ ] "sim" creates the expense
- [ ] "não" cancels the operation
- [ ] Various confirmation words work
- [ ] Various rejection words work
- [ ] Can start new conversation while pending
- [ ] Multiple expenses work in sequence
- [ ] Dates are correct in preview
- [ ] Categories are correct in preview
- [ ] Expenses are created correctly in database

## Known Behaviors

✅ **By Design**:
- If user says something ambiguous while pending, treats as new conversation (doesn't create or cancel)
- Only recognizes explicit confirmation/rejection words
- Preview uses same format as success message

❌ **Still Not Implemented** (Future Steps):
- Update/delete operations (Step 4)
- Contracts and receivables (Step 5)
- Batch operations (Step 6)
- Query Agent integration (Step 8)

## Troubleshooting

**Preview not showing**:
1. Check if Claude is returning JSON
2. Verify system prompt has expense schema
3. Check console for JSON parsing errors

**Confirmation not working**:
1. Verify pendingOperation is being passed to API
2. Check if confirmation word is in the list
3. Console log the normalized message

**Creates without asking**:
1. Verify Step 3 code is deployed
2. Check if preview message is being returned
3. Look for pendingOperation in response

**Can't cancel**:
1. Verify rejection words are recognized
2. Check if "não" is properly handled
3. Console log the rejection detection

## What's Next (Step 4)

After Step 3 is validated:
- Add update operations
- Add delete operations
- Query database to find expenses
- Multi-match handling
